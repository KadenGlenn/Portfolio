  <p> My name is Kaden Glenn, I am 16 years old, I live in Arizona. I currently attend Tolleson Union 
    High School and West-MEC. I am a United States citizen, and was born in Phoenix, Arizona. I take pride in my 
    work and often try my best to meet the standards and go further beyond. I am very fond of my family and friends, I do not 
    put much effort into things I dislike.
